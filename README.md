- Installed by downloading for windows machine. Provided password and kept default port and locale.
- Connected with SQL shell in windows
- Ran \l command to see what is in it at the moment
- Created a sample database using "create database db_name" command. db_name is sample, I used a name called testing.

- Downloaded sample zip file from sample database
- Used pg_restore command to import database to newly created empty database.
- Connected to database using \c command
- Looked into tables using \d command, also tested \dt and \dt+ command
- Practiced with selecting data using select & from command. The sample command to access actor table was select * from actor; (Used wildcard to access everything for now and didn't limit query)
- Accessed first name from actor table using select first_name from actor;
- Exited with CTRL+C
- Started playing with customer table. Used same select wildcard to see content
- Tested multiple field extraction with command select first_name, last_name, email from customer;
- Used select statement with expressions select first_name || ' ' || last_name, email from customer; and received desired data.
- Additional testing done with insert column, Alter tanle commands but require more practice with real time examples.
